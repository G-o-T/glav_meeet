This project was created for a real customer at the beggining of studing Frontend.
My role was:
- as a web-designer - to develop a responsive mock-up in Figma;
- as a developer - to perform adaptive layout of my part of the project (slider, advantages), supervise the most complex moments on the technical part of the team members.
